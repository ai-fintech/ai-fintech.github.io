bio: All my life I have been obsessed with scaling social impact at an international scale. My immigrant experience, as well as my intimate understanding of the trying financial circumstances in my youth, led to me having an obsession with global social impact, and more specifically, global financial empowerment. My focus on impact has guided everything I've done professionally-- from my undergraduate studies at Cal, serving as a court monitor for the Charles Taylor case in the Hague, serving for Teach For America, attending Berkeley Law School, my entry into tech as an early employee in an EdTech startup, and currently, my work leading Konviv. I regard my work at Konviv as the culmination of all my previous endeavors, and see it as my life's work.
