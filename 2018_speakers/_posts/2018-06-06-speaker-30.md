topic: AI and Blockchain for Social Good
description: The promise — and potential — of AI and blockchain to drive social impact is massive. Proponents contend AI and blockchain will touch, if not disrupt, every major industry and will even alter the way that people and societies interact. Technology that increases efficiency, reduces costs, and promotes transparency can have significant implications for sectors that are dedicated to driving social impact.

A first-generation college student from a low-income, immigrant family, Jorge hopes to leverage cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and AI to address social and economic issues, to reduce inequality, and to empower people around the world to attain a better life for themselves, their families, and their communities.
