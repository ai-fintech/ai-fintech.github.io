topic: Detecting Signals in News using Sentiment Analysis around ESG Scoring
description: More Info Soon
bio: I’m all about news data and the powerful signals found in it. Be it for sentiment analysis of your mom’s Wall Street-Journal-worthy blueberry pie tech venture, or for modeling supply chain risk; or for designing the next algorithmic investment strategy; or even for just understanding the networked impact of Brexit... or of a future hurricane... or of a president... I build solutions using the world’s most comprehensive premium news cloud API ecosystem - Dow Jones/DNA - Data, News and Analytics Platform.
