topic: AI - A key enabler to close the $2T trade finance gap
description: Trade finance is one of the world's largest industries. Yet we are faced with $2T in financing gap due to the inability for SMEs having access to affordable finance. This is largely due to the existing bank credit underwriting approach which is very rigid and antiquated. Our AI/machine learning approach allows for both better credit decisions and the improved access to credit for many businesses. Our goal is to transform the trade finance industry.
