topic: Panel - Using AI to drive down regulatory compliance costs in lending and AML
description: AI is widely touted as a viable and near-term solution for reducing the heavy burden financial institutions now face in complying with regulatory requirements, especially in the area of AML/KYC. Many current systems for monitoring compliance are outdated / ineffective as they cannot keep up with an ever increasing, day-to-day frequency and sophistication of financial transactions that take place worldwide. This situation is further exasperated by frequent changes/amendments to regulations governing compliance requirements in the United States and other countries around the globe. What can Todayâ€™s state of the art AI systems offer to address these challenges? The assembled panel consists of experts offering opinions from the perspective of a regulatory authority, financial institution and startup in the AI Fintech space.
