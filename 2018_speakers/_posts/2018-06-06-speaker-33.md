topic: Fighting Financial Crimes with AI
description: Financial Institutions face major challenges in the rapidly evolving area of AML and Financial Fraud. Current systems often rely heavily on rules or high degree of human supervision that is hard to scale and benchmark. We will discuss how an AI / Machine Learning based platform can help a financial institution by bringing together internal and external data sources.
