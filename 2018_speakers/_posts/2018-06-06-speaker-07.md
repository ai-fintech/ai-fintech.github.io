bio: I currently lead ICO companies through planning and execution of token sale offerings. My past experience spans startup incubation and venture capital, advertising, publishing, virtual reality, and Blockchain. I launched 2 new offices for a VC firm and led a crowdfunding campaign that blew through its funding goal on Kickstarter. My passion is to enable the exchange of innovative technologies and ideas across borders via tours, workshops and events, and virtual reality. Through my consulting practice and pro-bono advising, I help early-stage startups with Strategy, Business Development, Communications and Fundraising. I also advise mission-driven organizations that work on making city life better.
