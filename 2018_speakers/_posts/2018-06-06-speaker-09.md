topic: Providing Signal-to-Noise in the Blockchain Space
description: Stanford Law's CodeX Blockchain Group has identified "speculative noise" as a major impediment to the further advancement of the blockchain space. In response, and with the Law School administration's blessings, it has launched the Stanford Journal of Blockchain Law & Policy -- the first law journal to publish on the greater blockchain technology space. The Journal and other such initiatives must strive towards a united public policy front re blockchain tech in these times of uncertainty.
