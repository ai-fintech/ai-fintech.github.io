topic: Introduction to Blockchain/ICOs
description: An overview of the current market and regulatory challenges companies face when fundraising and launching native tokens. Companies entering this space are encountering a market that is largely unregulated, target users that are relatively unsophisticated, high instances of fraud and inexperienced advisors, no clear examples of a successful long-term roadmap, and regulatory uncertainty. Despite this, blockchain represents a paradigm-shift in technology worth understanding.
