description: In Computer science there is a famous expression, "Garbage in, Garbage out". Due to the vast need for Insample / Outsample training data for AI algorithms, it is especially important to have accurate historical and real time data to train such AI models. CoinRoutes provides data that allow s traders to train and maintain models. We cover recent market-structure events, as well as some potential use cases for AI in preventing Flash crashes and other events.
