topic: Changing the Paradigm of Data Economics with Crypto
description: How the convergence of AI & Blockchain mixed with the incentivization Crypto can change the paradigm of the data economy. Large Tech companies have a huge amount of control over the AI marketplace, systems , and tech; their rich data sets allowed them to capitalize first off of the AI revolution and create a dynamic not in line with value creation for end users. The average person's data creates $10,000 of value/yr for these large companies. AI + Crypto can change this.
