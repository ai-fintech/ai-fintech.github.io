        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Stanford Law's CodeX Blockchain Group has identified "speculative noise" as a major impediment to the further advancement of the blockchain space. In response, and with the Law School administration's blessings, it has launched the Stanford Journal of Blockchain Law & Policy -- the first law journal to publish on the greater blockchain technology space. The Journal and other such initiatives must strive towards a united public policy front re blockchain tech in these times of uncertainty.</p>
