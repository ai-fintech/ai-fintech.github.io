        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>AI and ML technologies have significant potential to add tremendous value to human society. However, the current AI/ML paradigm that is based on centrally controlled systems, biased datasets, and unenfranchised users is fatally flawed and cases of abuse are rampant. Blockchain technologies, including ultra-secure and immutable ledgers, strong, consensus mechanisms, decentralization, and self-sovereign identity have tremendous potential to rebalance and improve AI/ML algorithms.</p>
